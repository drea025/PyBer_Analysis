# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview of Analysis 
The purpose of the analysis is to showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, rider and drivers by type city. The goal is to help Pyber improve access to ride-sharing services and to determine affordabilty for underserved neighborhoods. 
In this analysis we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type: urban, suburban, and rural. Looking at the ride count, average fare and average number of drivers, we also compared each city's average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. Additionally, we created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, averages for fare per ride and fare per driver. 

## Results
Looking at the summary data frame, one can notice that the average fare per Ride is much higher in rural areas. This could be explained by the total number of rides in rural city types that is about 5 times less than the rides in suburban areas and about 10 times less than rides in urban areas. The lack of rides in rural areas may explain the higher average fare per ride, in order to compensate for the lack of rides.

The multiple-line graph can provide a more detailed summary of the number of rides throught the months of Janurary through April. The total fare in urban areas tends to fluctuate however it does have the highest number of total fares. During the month of Februrary ride fare cost increases about twice the amount and then falls back down to around during the beginning of March. ![Fig8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100797549/163692742-e87c26c1-848a-4044-9375-9d1cc166eb4d.png)

## Summary
The biggest take-aways from this analysis are that having less drivers can increase the average fare per ride, one can manipluate the avaibilty of drivers in an area in order to reach the desired profit goal. Also there are spontaneous peaks of increased total fares for all city types in the month of February, discovering why this occurs can provide valuable insight for the company as well. The average fare per ride also has a slight increase in more populated cities, but the average fare per drive increases as well which may make it more difficult for underserved communites to afford rides in rural areas with the lower number of drivers designated in those cities.
